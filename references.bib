abstract = {This study highlights the significant role of the genetic repertoire of a microorganism in the similarity between Novosphingobium strains. The results suggest that the phylogenetic relationships were mostly influenced by metabolic trait enrichment, which is possibly governed by the microenvironment of each microbe's respective niche. Using core genome analysis, the enrichment of a certain set of genes specific to a particular habitat was determined, which provided insights on the influence of habitat on the distribution of metabolic traits for Novosphingobium strains. We also identified habitat-specific protein hubs, which suggested delineation of Novosphingobium strains based on their habitat. Examining the available genomes of ecologically diverse bacterial species and analyzing the habitat-specific genes are useful for understanding the distribution and evolution of functional and phylogenetic diversity in the genus Novosphingobium . Species belonging to the genus Novosphingobium are found in many different habitats and have been identified as metabolically versatile. Through comparative genomic analysis, we identified habitat-specific genes and regulatory hubs that could determine habitat selection for Novosphingobium spp. Genomes from 27 Novosphingobium strains isolated from diverse habitats such as rhizosphere soil, plant surfaces, heavily contaminated soils, and marine and freshwater environments were analyzed. Genome size and coding potential were widely variable, differing significantly between habitats. Phylogenetic relationships between strains were less likely to describe functional genotype similarity than the habitat from which they were isolated. In this study, strains (19 out of 27) with a recorded habitat of isolation, and at least 3 representative strains per habitat, comprised four ecological groups—rhizosphere, contaminated soil, marine, and freshwater. Sulfur acquisition and metabolism were the only core genomic traits to differ significantly in proportion between these ecological groups; for example, alkane sulfonate ( ssuABCD ) assimilation was found exclusively in all of the rhizospheric isolates. When we examined osmolytic regulation in Novosphingobium spp. through ectoine biosynthesis, which was assumed to be marine habitat specific, we found that it was also present in isolates from contaminated soil, suggesting its relevance beyond the marine system. Novosphingobium strains were also found to harbor a wide variety of mono- and dioxygenases, responsible for the metabolism of several aromatic compounds, suggesting their potential to act as degraders of a variety of xenobiotic compounds. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed $\beta$-barrel outer membrane proteins as habitat-specific hubs in each of the four habitats—freshwater (Saro{\_}1868), marine water (PP1Y{\_}AT17644), rhizosphere (PMI02{\_}00367), and soil (V474{\_}17210). These outer membrane proteins could play a key role in habitat demarcation and extend our understanding of the metabolic versatility of the Novosphingobium species.

abstract = {Detrimental host-pathogen interactions are a normal phenomenon in aquaculture animal production, and have been counteracted by prophylactic use of antibiotics. Especially, the youngest life stages of cultivated aquatic animals are susceptible to pathogen invasion, resulting in disease and mortality. To establish a more sustainable aquatic food production, there is a need for new microbial management strategies that focus on 'join them' and not the traditional 'beat them' approaches. We argue that ecological theory could serve as a foundation for developing sustainable microbial management methods that prevent pathogenic disease in larviculture. Management of the water microbiota in aquaculture systems according to ecological selection principles has been shown to decrease opportunistic pathogen pressure and to result in an improved performance of the cultured animals. We hypothesize that manipulation of the biodiversity of the gut microbiota can increase the host's resistance against pathogenic invasion and infection. However, substantial barriers need to be overcome before active management of the intestinal microbiota can effectively be applied in larviculture.},

@article{Bartelme2019,
abstract = {Flowthrough and pond aquaculture system microbiome management practices aim to mitigate fish disease and stress. However, the operational success of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) depends directly on system microbial community activities. In RAS, each component environment is engineered for a specific microbial niche for waste management, as the water continuously flowing through the system must be processed before returning to the rearing tank. In this study, we compared waste management component microbiomes (rearing tank water, pH correction tank, solid-waste clarifier, biofilter, and degassing tower) within a commercial-scale freshwater RAS by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To assess consistency among freshwater RAS microbiomes, we also compared the microbial community compositions of six aquaculture and aquaponic farms. Community assemblages reflected site and source water relationships, and the presence of a hydroponic subsystem was a major community determinant. In contrast to the facility-specific community composition, some sequence variants, mainly classified into Flavobacterium , Cetobacterium , the family Sphingomonadaceae , and nitrifying guilds of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira , were common across all facilities. The findings of this study suggest that, independently of system design, core taxa exist across RAS rearing similar fish species but that system design informs the individual aquatic microbiome assemblages. Future RAS design would benefit from understanding the roles of these core taxa and then capitalizing on their activities to further reduce system waste/added operational controls. IMPORTANCE Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are agroecosystems for intensive on-land cultivation of products of fisheries. Practitioners that incorporate edible plant production into RAS refer to these facilities as aquaponic systems (AP). RAS have the potential to offset declining production levels of wild global fisheries while reducing waste and product distance to market, but system optimization is needed to reduce costs. Both RAS and AP rely on microbial consortia for maintaining water quality and promoting fish/plant health, but little is known about the microorganisms actually present. This lack of knowledge prevents optimization of designs and operational controls to target the growth of beneficial microbial species or consortia. The significance of our research is in identifying the common microorganisms that inhabit production RAS and AP and the operational factors that influence which microorganisms colonize and become abundant. Identifying these organisms is a first step toward advanced control of microbial activities that improve reproducibility and reduce costs.},

@article{Eck2019,
abstract = {Aquaponics is a production system based on the dynamic equilibrium between fish, plants, and microorganisms. In order to better understand the role of microorganisms in this tripartite relationship, we studied the bacterial communities hosted in eight aquaponic and aquaculture systems. The bacterial communities were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing. At the phylum level, the bacterial communities from all systems were relatively similar with a predominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, however, the communities present in the sampled systems were more heterogeneous. The biofilter samples harbored more diverse communities than the corresponding sump samples. The core microbiomes from the coupled and decoupled systems shared more common operational taxonomic units than with the aquaculture systems. Eventually, some of the taxa identified in the systems could have beneficial functions for plant growth and health, but a deeper analysis would be required to identify the precise functions involved in aquaponics.},

@article{Zwart2002,
abstract = {In order to identify patterns in bacterial community composition in freshwater habitats, we analyzed the available database of 16S rDNA sequences from freshwater plankton, including 24 new sequences from Parker River (Massachusetts, USA), 42 from Lake Soyang (South Korea) and 148 from Lake IJssel (The Netherlands). At this point, combined diversity studies using random cloning have deposited 689 bacterial and 75 plastid 16S rDNA sequences from the water column of rivers and lakes in North America, Europe and Asia. Systematic comparisons with the global database showed that the majority of the bacterial sequences were most closely related to other freshwater clones or isolates, while relatively few were closest to sequences recovered from soils or marine habitats. This habitat-specific clustering suggests that the clustered 16S rDNA sequences represent species or groups of species that are indigenous to freshwater. We have discerned 34 phylogenetic clusters of closely related sequences that are either restricted to freshwater or dominated by freshwater sequences. Of these clusters, 23 contained no cultivated organisms. These putative freshwater clusters were found among the alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group, the Cyanobacteria, the Actinobacteria, the Verrucomicrobia, the green non-sulfur bacteria and candidate division OP10. This study shows that rivers and lakes have a specific planktonic bacterial community distinct from bacteria in neighboring environments such as soil and sediments. It also points out that these planktonic bacteria are distributed in diverse freshwater ecosystems around the world.},
